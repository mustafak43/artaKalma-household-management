# Firebase Notification Sender

The 'Firebase Notification Sender' project, which was created for a competition in Turkey called TEKNOFEST, is aimed at simplifying household management and communication.

## Overview

In today's fast-paced world, keeping track of shopping lists and sharing real-time updates with housemates can be a challenge. This project leverages the power of Flutter, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and the convenience of mobile applications to streamline these processes. By allowing residents to manage shopping lists and receive instant notifications when items are bought or about to expire, this project brings efficiency and coordination to daily household tasks. While primarily designed for personal use, the project serves as a testament to the potential of modern technology in addressing practical, real-life scenarios.

## Usage

The project is designed to work in conjunction with a mobile application developed using Flutter. The app enables house residents to manage a shopping list and mark items as 'Bought,' which are then organized in the 'Fridge' section. When an item is marked as 'Bought,' the back-end of the app sends the necessary information to the Firebase Cloud Messaging System. This triggers notifications to inform other house residents that a purchase has been made. Users are also notified if something in the fridge is about to expire.
