# firebase notification sender
 Test code used for an application in a competition.
 
Server updates its data every few seconds to match with the correct version of database to be able to make appropriate requests to firebase cloud messaging service at will (when certain functions are triggered within the app), which in turn firebase cloud messaging service also sends appropriate payloads to operating system matching with the token provided to trigger notifications being pop-up in the device.
